# Minimum requirements for being a good software engineer

This is intended for an engineer before a first professional job.
I am writing this because I find junior engineers lacking basic knowledge and skills
and this lack projects years into their careers leading to career slowdown.

## Knowledge

A good engineer should know how things work inside. 
If you write code and do not know how it is compiled and executed, 
you will not be able to design efficient products. 
To rely on the designers of languages, libraries, containers and operating systems, clouds to do the best job, 
you must know how these products are designed and structured in order to choose a correct produst and use it efficiently.
For example, every language has concurrency but their design goals and correspondingly implementations are so different. We'll get to this below.

I prefer to learn from bottom up and therefore I'll start with hardware.

Keep in mind that in order to know something, you have to do it. 
Therefore most sections describe not only what you should know but also what you should try.

### Hardware

At the end of the day, whatever you write runs on hardware and if you want to be methodical in learning engineering, start with hardware.

Take a simple controller, such as Arduino, with 1 sensor and 1 output device and write a loop that does something simple.

No need to dive deeper unless you want to go into firmware engineering 
which actually is a great field due to the rapid development of robotics, automation, AI

### C

Learn C which is the foundation for today's mostly used languages. If you take Arduino route described above, you'll learn basic C.

### Languages

Learn what types of computer languages there are. What considerations go into the design of languages.

### Compilation

There are several approaches to parsing and compiling programming languages. 
Learn about them.
Design a simple language that has int, float, conditions, loops and functions.
Then implement it. There are online articles that explain how to build your own lexer, parser, interpreter or compiler both from scratch and using existing products.
Building anything from scratch in C is better for understanding how things work.

### Linux

Learn how Linux manages
- multiple processes and threads
- memory
- IO (devices and data)
- file systems

Learn basic shell commands that show information about and manage processors, memory, file systems and files, network, devices, processes and threads.

### Concurrency

### Networking

### Docker

### Storage

### Horizontal scaling

### Cloud

### GPU

### Specialized but useful

#### Web UI

#### Apps

#### 3D graphics
