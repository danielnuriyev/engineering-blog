# Useful Programming Languages

There are multiple programming languages because they were designed for different uses and because languages evolve: better languages replace older languages.

I will list by areas of use:

## Mobile Apps

Dart is a language by Google for cross platform native mobile apps. 
It is compiled and executed directly on top of an OS avoiding a bridget between the OS and the code.
Dart can also be compiled to run as JavaScript in a browser and for backend APIs.

Sometimes you need to call a mobile OS directly. For this use Kotlin on Android and Swift on iOS. On Android you can even use C.
