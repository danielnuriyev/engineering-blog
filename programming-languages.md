# Useful Programming Languages

There are multiple programming languages because they were designed for different uses and because languages evolve: better languages replace older languages.

I will list by the area of use

## Mobile Apps

Dart is a language by Google for cross platform native mobile apps. 
It is compiled and executed directly on top of an OS avoiding a bridge between the OS and the code.
Dart can also be compiled to run as JavaScript in a browser and for backend applications.

In some cases you may need functionality not implemented in Dart.
For this use Kotlin on Android and Swift on iOS. 
If you need to go lower in stack use C++ on Android and Objective C on iOS.

## Web Apps

JavaScript is the language of a browser.

## Desktop Apps

- Windows: The language of choice in C# but you have more options as explained [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/?tabs=net-maui%2Ccpp-win32)
- MacOS: Swift
- Linux: depends on the desktop environment. Since the two mostly used ones are Xfce and GNOME, C is a safe bet. They have bindings for C++ which I recommend because small and simple projects sometimes grow in complexity and this is one of the reasons why C++ was invented. There are bindings for Python and JavaScript but once you learn how to code for Xfce and GNOME in C, you'll be able to do anything which is not necessarily the case for other languages.

For all Operating Systems, you may need to lower in stack and use C++ or even C.

## Backend

## OS and Hardware
